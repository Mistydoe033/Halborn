/**
 * @title HalbornLoans_Test - Critical UUPS and Reentrancy Exploits
 * @dev This contract demonstrates multiple critical vulnerabilities in the HalbornLoans contract:
 *
 * EXPLOIT VECTORS COVERED:
 * 1. UUPS Upgrade Bypass (Critical) - Anyone can upgrade the contract
 * 2. Arbitrary Token Minting (Critical) - Post-upgrade token inflation
 * 3. Arbitrary Token Burning (Critical) - Post-upgrade fund destruction
 * 4. Reentrancy Attack (Critical) - Bypass collateral accounting via onERC721Received
 *
 * ROOT CAUSE: Empty _authorizeUpgrade() function allows unrestricted upgrades
 * IMPACT: Complete protocol takeover, infinite token minting, user fund theft
